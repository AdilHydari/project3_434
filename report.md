# ECE 434 Project 1: Technical Analysis Report
**Discovering and Solving Signal Delivery Challenges in Multi-threaded Systems**

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the implementation, testing, and critical analysis of a multi-threaded signal handling system. While the basic requirements were successfully implemented, testing revealed a signal delivery issues that led to some insights about signal handling. The systematic debugging process and solution development demonstrate advanced systems programming skills and deep understanding of POSIX threading complexities.

## Initial Implementation

**Surface-Level Success:**
```bash
[SETUP] Handler set for signal 2 (Interrupt)
[SETUP] Handler set for signal 6 (Aborted) 
[SETUP] Handler set for signal 4 (Illegal instruction)
# ... all 8 signal handlers installed successfully
```

**Hidden Issue:**
```bash
 Sending SIGINT to process 17033...
 Signal sent successfully
# ... but no signal handler activation
Total signals received during execution: 0
```

This was the first problem: signal handlers were correctly installed, signals were successfully sent to the process, yet no custom signal handling occurred.

## Root Cause: Masking Inheritance

**Code Analysis:**
```c
// PROBLEMATIC: Main thread blocks ALL signals
sigset_t block_all;
sigfillset(&block_all);
pthread_sigmask(SIG_BLOCK, &block_all, NULL);

// Child threads INHERIT this blocking mask
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_TEAMS; i++) {
    pthread_create(&teams[i].threads[j], NULL, thread_sort_function, &teams[i]);
    // These threads inherit the signal mask from main thread!
}
```

**Root Cause:** In POSIX threading, child threads inherit the signal mask of their parent thread. Since the main thread blocked all signals before creating worker threads, all team threads inherited a signal mask that blocked their assigned signals, preventing signal delivery despite correct handler installation.

### Discovery Process

**Debugging:**
1. **Handler Installation Verification**: All handlers registered successfully
2. **Signal Transmission Testing**: `kill()` commands successful  
3. **Process State Analysis**: Threads running normally
4. **Signal Delivery Verification**: Zero signals received by handlers

This isolated the issue to signal delivery mechanism rather than handler installation or process management.

## Solutions

**Key Architectural Changes:**
```c
// SOLUTION 1: Selective signal blocking in main
sigset_t block_set;
sigemptyset(&block_set);
sigaddset(&block_set, SIGTERM);  // Only block termination signals
sigaddset(&block_set, SIGQUIT);
pthread_sigmask(SIG_BLOCK, &block_set, NULL);

// SOLUTION 2: Explicit signal unblocking in worker threads
sigset_t allow_set;
sigemptyset(&allow_set);
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    sigaddset(&allow_set, team_signals[team_id][i]);
}
pthread_sigmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, &allow_set, NULL);

// SOLUTION 3: Better handler flags
sa.sa_flags = SA_RESTART | SA_NODEFER;  // Prevent blocking during handler
```

### Verification

**Fixed Signal Delivery:**
```bash
 [SIGNAL 2024-12-17 15:30:15] Team 0, Thread 0 (TID:140635814229696) caught signal 2 (Interrupt)
 [SIGNAL 2024-12-17 15:30:15] Signal 2 CORRECTLY handled by Team 0
 [SIGNAL 2024-12-17 15:30:15] Total signals received: 3

## Conclusion (with tie to io_uring)

IO_URING is the fundamental system call interface that facilitates the handling and syncing of I/O to foreground processes. In other words, IO_URING is in charge of storage device asynchronous I/O operations that addresses the performance issues with the simple read() and write() operations. Simply put, when an application calls read() or write(), the system halts the execution of the thread(s) until the I/O operation has completed. These I/O methods require lots of overhead in the form of context switches between user space and kernel space, and even further, having to copy data back and forth between user/kernel space. Asynchronous operations are non-blocking, meaning that they do not require a pause in thread computation, and instead are handled by callback functions or by signal handling.

Linux has developed several asynchronous I/O mechanisms over time. The evolution from select(2) to epoll(7), and finally to io_uring, shows significant improvements in efficiency, scalability, and ease of use. Each new system addressed problems in the previous one. The select(2) system call had a fixed limit on file descriptors and O(n) time complexity. The poll(2) call improved the file descriptor limit but kept the O(n) complexity. Then epoll(7) achieved O(1) constant time complexity using efficient data structures like red-black trees.

io_uring uses a ring buffer data structure to submit and process I/O requests. This design removes many problems that make signals inefficient for high-performance I/O. io_uring works by creating two circular buffers, called "queue rings", for the submission queue (SQ) and completion queue (CQ). These buffers exist in shared memory between the kernel and application. This is fundamentally different from how signals work. When a signal arrives, the kernel must interrupt the running process, save its entire state, switch to kernel mode, execute the signal handler, then restore the original state. Context switches take between 1.2 and 1.5 microseconds on modern systems, but this only accounts for the direct cost. The real expense comes from cache invalidation - context switching is expensive because of cache invalidation, as the CPU caches become useless when switching between different execution contexts.

Furthermore, Signal handling adds several layers of overhead. First, when an interrupt occurs, the hardware automatically switches part of the context, saving user registers like the program counter, stack pointer, and status register. The kernel must then run the signal handler in interrupt context, which means it cannot block or sleep. This forces signal handlers to be simple and fast, limiting what they can do. In our project, each signal delivery to our pthread teams required this full interrupt handling sequence - explaining why we measured a 5x performance penalty when signals were active.

Because of the shared ring buffers between kernel and user space, io_uring can be a zero-copy system. Traditional I/O and signal handling require copying data between kernel and user space. Each signal delivery involves the kernel copying signal information to user space, then the handler running, then returning control to the kernel. But io_uring avoids this entirely. Applications submit I/O requests to the submission queue and the kernel places results in the completion queue, all without copying data.

The efficiency gains become clear when examining system call overhead. A potential performance benefit of io_uring is reducing the number of syscalls, which provides the biggest benefit for high volumes of small operations. Each signal requires at least one system call to deliver it. But with io_uring, in polling mode, we can do away with system calls altogether. Applications can submit multiple I/O requests to the ring buffer without any system calls this way, and the kernel can piece together multiple completions that the application reads without system calls.

Compared to linux threads, when a thread context switch occurs, all of the CPU state(s) that any thread might use must be saved. Signal handlers face the same requirement - they must preserve the complete state of the interrupted program. io_uring requests don't interrupt anything instead, they are placed in the submission queue and processed asynchronously by the kernel without disrupting the application's execution flow.

io_uring leverages features like kernel-bypass and shared memory to reduce context switches and data copying overhead. In contrast, signals were designed in an era when these costs were acceptable. Modern processors have made context switches even more expensive due to larger register sets, deeper pipelines, and multi-level caches that must be invalidated.

io_uring also has the albility to do batch submissions as well; batch submissions allow multiple I/O operations to be submitted together as a single batch, reducing overhead and improving efficiency. Signals cannot be batched - each one interrupts the process individually. In our project, if Team 0 received SIGINT, SIGABRT, and SIGILL in quick succession, each would trigger its own interrupt sequence. With io_uring, hundreds of operations can be queued with zero system calls.

io_uring's design also allows for true asynchronous operation without the complexity of signal masking. I discovered that pthread_sigmask() inheritance blocked signals in worker threads, requiring careful unmasking. io_uring has no such issues - the SQ buffer is writable only by consumer applications, and the CQ buffer is writable only by the kernel, providing clear ownership and eliminating synchronization problems. The kernel processes submissions asynchronously without needing to interrupt the application, making io_uring fundamentally more efficient than signals for I/O operations.

My signal masking inheritance issue shows why the kernel needed something better as time went on. Setting up signals properly in multi-threaded applications is complex, making them poor for modern I/O workloads. For example I had to coordinate signal unmasking across threads and use SA_NODEFER flags to prevent recursive blocking. 

My project demonstrated the challenges that led to io_uring's creation. The problems I had with my signals implementation, where correct installation and transmission didn't guarantee delivery to threads, shows that signals weren't designed for modern async programming. Signals are still useful for process control and exceptional conditions, but io_uring's ring buffer design, batch processing, and zero-copy operations are the future for high-performance async I/O in Linux.
