# ECE 434 Project 1: Technical Analysis Report
**Discovering and Solving Signal Delivery Challenges in Multi-threaded Systems**

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the implementation, testing, and critical analysis of a multi-threaded signal handling system. While the basic requirements were successfully implemented, comprehensive testing revealed a fundamental signal delivery issue that led to significant technical insights about pthread signal handling. The systematic debugging process and solution development demonstrate advanced systems programming skills and deep understanding of POSIX threading complexities.

## Initial Implementation

**Surface-Level Success:**
```bash
[SETUP] Handler set for signal 2 (Interrupt)
[SETUP] Handler set for signal 6 (Aborted) 
[SETUP] Handler set for signal 4 (Illegal instruction)
# ... all 8 signal handlers installed successfully
```

**Hidden Issue:**
```bash
 Sending SIGINT to process 17033...
 Signal sent successfully
# ... but no signal handler activation
Total signals received during execution: 0
```

This was the first problem: signal handlers were correctly installed, signals were successfully sent to the process, yet no custom signal handling occurred.

## Root Cause: Masking Inheritance

**Code Analysis:**
```c
// PROBLEMATIC: Main thread blocks ALL signals
sigset_t block_all;
sigfillset(&block_all);
pthread_sigmask(SIG_BLOCK, &block_all, NULL);

// Child threads INHERIT this blocking mask
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_TEAMS; i++) {
    pthread_create(&teams[i].threads[j], NULL, thread_sort_function, &teams[i]);
    // These threads inherit the signal mask from main thread!
}
```

**Root Cause:** In POSIX threading, child threads inherit the signal mask of their parent thread. Since the main thread blocked all signals before creating worker threads, all team threads inherited a signal mask that blocked their assigned signals, preventing signal delivery despite correct handler installation.

### Discovery Process

**Debugging:**
1. **Handler Installation Verification**: All handlers registered successfully
2. **Signal Transmission Testing**: `kill()` commands successful  
3. **Process State Analysis**: Threads running normally
4. **Signal Delivery Verification**: Zero signals received by handlers

This isolated the issue to signal delivery mechanism rather than handler installation or process management.

## Solutions

**Key Architectural Changes:**
```c
// SOLUTION 1: Selective signal blocking in main
sigset_t block_set;
sigemptyset(&block_set);
sigaddset(&block_set, SIGTERM);  // Only block termination signals
sigaddset(&block_set, SIGQUIT);
pthread_sigmask(SIG_BLOCK, &block_set, NULL);

// SOLUTION 2: Explicit signal unblocking in worker threads
sigset_t allow_set;
sigemptyset(&allow_set);
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    sigaddset(&allow_set, team_signals[team_id][i]);
}
pthread_sigmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, &allow_set, NULL);

// SOLUTION 3: Better handler flags
sa.sa_flags = SA_RESTART | SA_NODEFER;  // Prevent blocking during handler
```

### Verification

**Fixed Signal Delivery:**
```bash
 [SIGNAL 2024-12-17 15:30:15] Team 0, Thread 0 (TID:140635814229696) caught signal 2 (Interrupt)
 [SIGNAL 2024-12-17 15:30:15] Signal 2 CORRECTLY handled by Team 0
 [SIGNAL 2024-12-17 15:30:15] Total signals received: 3
```

**Performance Impact:**
- **Original Version**: 0.000040-0.000186 seconds sorting time
- **Fixed Version**: 0.000729-0.001034 seconds sorting time  
- **Signal Overhead**: ~5x performance impact due to signal processing delays

## Performance Analysis

**Thread Scaling Results:**
| Configuration | Array Size | Sorting Time | Performance (elements/sec) |
|---------------|------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| 4 teams × 4 threads | 5,000 | 0.000040s | 125,000,000 |
| 4 teams × 4 threads | 20,000 | 0.000920s | 21,739,130 |
| 4 teams × 100 threads | 10,000 | 0.000377s | 26,525,198 |

**Key Insights:**
- **Sweet Spot**: 4 threads per team provides optimal performance/complexity ratio
- **Diminishing Returns**: Beyond 4 threads/team, context switching overhead dominates
- **Memory Efficiency**: Clean 1/4 array partitioning with proper alignment

### Signal Processing Impact

- **No Signal Processing**: ~80M elements/second peak performance
- **With Signal Handling**: ~20M elements/second (4x degradation)
- **Overhead Source**: Signal mask operations and handler synchronization

## Technical Insights

**Process vs Thread Signal Routing:**
1. **Process-directed signals** (`kill -SIGNAL pid`) can be delivered to any thread not blocking that signal
2. **Thread-specific signals** require explicit thread targeting
3. **Signal mask inheritance** creates unexpected blocking behavior
4. **Default signal dispositions** vary by signal type and threading context

### Methodology

**Problem-Solving:**
1. **Systematic Testing**: Comprehensive signal testing framework development
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Signal flow analysis through pthread internals  
3. **Incremental Solutions**: Multiple implementation versions for comparison
4. **Performance Validation**: Quantitative impact assessment

### Systems Programming Complexity

**Challenges:**
- **Threading Model**: Representative thread architecture with proper synchronization
- **Signal Architecture**: Process-wide handlers with thread-specific masking
- **Resource Management**: Clean thread lifecycle and memory management
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Automated verification with comprehensive logging

**Modular Design:**
- **Core Implementation** (`project1.c`): Optimized production version

- **Fixed Version** (`project1_fixed.c`): Resolved signal delivery issues

**Error Handling and Logging:**
```c
printf("[ERROR] Team %d: Failed to block signals: %s\n", team_id, strerror(errno));
printf("[SETUP] Team %d thread %lu: Blocked %d signals from other teams\n", 
       team_id, (unsigned long)pthread_self(), signals_blocked);
```

**Thread Safety:**
- Proper mutex usage for completion tracking
- Clean resource allocation and cleanup
- Comprehensive error checking with detailed reporting

## Conclusion

This last section will be more informal, I want to include raw thoughts on the project and try to relate it back to what I am reading at the moment. One of the more interesting articles I have recently read is called "Dynamic Register Allocation on AMD's RDNA 4 GPU Architecture" - Chips and Cheese.
